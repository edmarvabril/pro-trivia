# This is a light version of a Trivia Quiz App. Currently optimized for iOS.

# Getting Started

## 'yarn install'
## 'npx pod-install ios'
## 'yarn ios' or 'yarn android'

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
